# Anime tracking FAQ

!!! warning **Read this before starting the process**
Anime tracking process works with **only anime extensions**. So, it'll not work with extensions like superstream, sflix, loklok etc. Some anime extensions might also not work with the tracking process as the sources don't contain all the required metadata.

## Tracking

- When you go to the eps page of an anime, you will see the tracker icon (Logo of AL or MAL) at the top right corner. Click on that and you will see the tracking menu.

- The tracker will **automatically** track your anime after finishing the eps. Or you can **manually** input the number of eps you have watched.
