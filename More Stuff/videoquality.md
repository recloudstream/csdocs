## x264 vs x265
x264 and x265 are both video codecs that are used for compressing video files. They are both open-source and are widely supported by various media players and devices.

x264 is a codec that uses the H.264 standard for compression. H.264 is a widely adopted video compression standard that provides good video quality at relatively low bitrates. It is commonly used for encoding video files for a variety of purposes, including streaming, broadcasting, and storage.

x265, on the other hand, is a codec that uses the H.265 (HEVC) standard for compression. H.265 is a more advanced standard than H.264 and it allows for better compression, meaning that video files can be smaller while still maintaining the same level of quality. It also supports higher resolutions like 4K and 8K. However, some devices may not be able to play H.265 encoded videos.

!!!light Summary
x264 is a codec that uses H.264 standard and x265 uses H.265 standard for compression. x265 will provide better compression and higher resolution support but it requires more computational power. x264 is more widely supported and can be played on more devices, but the video quality may not be as good for the same bitrate.

## WEB-DL vs WEB-Rip
WEB-DL stands for "Web-Download." It is a term used to describe a type of video file that has been downloaded from the internet, as opposed to being bought on a physical medium like a DVD or Blu-ray. WEB-DL files are typically high-quality versions of movies or TV shows that have been downloaded from streaming services or torrent websites. These files are usually in the format of .mkv or .mp4 and have been compressed using a codec such as x264 or x265. The quality of WEB-DL files can be higher than that of standard definition (SD) or even high definition (HD) files, as they are usually sourced from the original high-definition master.

WEBRip is a type of video file that is typically sourced from a streaming service, such as Netflix or Amazon Prime, and then recorded and re-encoded by an individual. Because the video is recorded and re-encoded, the quality may vary and it may not be as high as the original source.

!!!light Summary
WEBRip is a type of video file that is typically sourced from a streaming service and then recorded and re-encoded by an individual, whereas WEB-DL is a term used to describe a type of video file that has been downloaded directly from the internet and the quality is typically higher than WEBRip.

## REMUX vs DVD-Rip
A remux is a type of video file that is a remastered version of the original source. It takes the video and audio streams from the original source and puts them into a new container format, such as MKV or MP4, without changing the compression or encoding of the streams. This means that the quality of the video and audio is exactly the same as the original source. The main advantage of a remux is that it allows for better compatibility with different media players and devices, as well as smaller file sizes.

A DVDrip, on the other hand, is a type of video file that is typically created by ripping the video and audio streams from a DVD. The compression and encoding of the streams may be changed during the ripping process, which can result in a loss of quality. DVDrip files are usually in the format of AVI or MP4 and have a lower resolution than the original DVD.

!!!light Summary
A remux is a type of video file that is a remastered version of the original source and it keeps the same quality and just change the container format, whereas a DVDrip is a type of video file that is typically created by ripping the video and audio streams from a DVD, which may result in a loss of quality.

## Blu-ray
Blu-ray video quality is a high-definition video standard that offers a higher resolution and better picture quality than standard definition (SD) or even high-definition (HD) video. Blu-ray video typically has a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels (1080p) and it can also support 4K resolution (3840x2160 pixels) and 8K resolution (7680x4320 pixels).

The picture quality of Blu-ray video is typically much sharper and more detailed than that of SD or HD video. It has a wider range of colors, brightness, and contrast, which allows for more lifelike and vibrant images. It also supports lossless surround sound audio codecs such as DTS-HD Master Audio, Dolby TrueHD, and more.

Blu-ray video also supports a variety of advanced features such as interactive menus, subtitles, and multiple audio tracks. Additionally, Blu-ray players usually have built-in hardware decoders for advanced video codecs such as H.264, VC-1 and MPEG-4, which allows for smoother playback of video content.

!!!light Summary
Blu-ray video quality is a high-definition video standard that offers a higher resolution and better picture quality than standard definition (SD) or even high-definition (HD) video, it also supports lossless surround sound audio codecs and advanced features such as interactive menus, subtitles, and multiple audio tracks.

## DS4K
DS4K stands for "Downscaled 4K." It is a video resolution where a 4K (Ultra High Definition) video is downscaled to a lower resolution, such as 1080p (Full HD) for streaming or distribution purposes. OTT providers often compress their 4K contents poorly to manage their server traffic. That's why encoders downscale the 4K version with good bitrate, sharpness, details, etc. 

## SDR vs HDR vs HDR10 vs HDR10+

### SDR
SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) is the standard for displaying images on most traditional displays, such as TVs and computer monitors. SDR images have a limited range of brightness and color, and typically look less vibrant and realistic compared to HDR (High Dynamic Range) images.

### HDR
HDR (High Dynamic Range) is a newer technology that enhances the brightness, contrast, and color range of images, resulting in more vivid and realistic images. HDR images have a wider range of brightness and color than SDR images, and they can display brighter whites and darker blacks.

HDR10 and HDR10+ are both HDR video formats, but they have some differences.

### HDR10
HDR10 is an open, industry-standard HDR format that is supported by most HDR-enabled TVs and devices. It uses static metadata to define the maximum and minimum brightness levels of an image, and this metadata is embedded in the video.

### HDR10+
HDR10+ is a newer HDR format that is developed by Samsung and it uses dynamic metadata, which can adjust the brightness and color levels on a scene-by-scene or even frame-by-frame basis. This allows for more accurate and consistent HDR images, and it can provide a more immersive viewing experience. However, it is not as widely supported as HDR10 and it's only supported by some Samsung and Panasonic TVs and devices.

!!!light Summary
SDR is the standard for displaying images on most traditional displays, HDR enhances the brightness, contrast, and color range of images, HDR10 is an open, industry-standard HDR format and HDR10+ is a newer HDR format developed by Samsung that uses dynamic metadata for more accurate and consistent HDR images.

## Dolby Vision
Dolby Vision is a high-dynamic-range (HDR) video format developed by Dolby Laboratories. It is designed to provide a more immersive viewing experience by expanding the range of colors and brightness levels that can be displayed on screen.

Dolby Vision uses a combination of hardware and software to process video content, allowing it to display a wider range of colors and brightness levels than standard dynamic range (SDR) video. It also uses a technique called "dynamic metadata" which allows the color and brightness to be adjusted on a scene-by-scene or even frame-by-frame basis, rather than a static adjustment for the entire movie or TV show.

Dolby Vision is compatible with a wide range of devices, including televisions, streaming devices, and Ultra HD Blu-ray players, and it is supported by many streaming services and content providers.

Keep in mind that to fully experience Dolby Vision, both the content and the playback device must be Dolby Vision compatible. Some devices only support Dolby Vision on streaming and not on physical media.

!!!light Summary
Dolby Vision is an HDR video format that enhances the range of colors and brightness levels on screen. It uses advanced processing techniques to improve the viewing experience and is compatible with a wide range of devices and supported by many streaming services. To fully experience Dolby Vision, both the content and the playback device must be Dolby Vision compatible.
