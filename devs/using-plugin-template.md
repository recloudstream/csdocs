# Using the template
The easiest way to start developing is to use our [plugin-template](https://github.com/recloudstream/plugin-template) as it sets up the build environment automatically.

1) <a href="https://github.com/recloudstream/plugin-template/generate" target="_blank">Use our plugin template</a>

2) Select `Include all branches`: <!-- - ![Include all branches image](../use-template.png) -->

3) Check if GitHub actions are enabled, by going to: `Settings > Actions > General > Allow all actions and reusable workflows`

4) You can now create your own plugins and after you push new code, they should automatically be built
